# Compilation #
###############
To compile a simple:
$ javac *.java
will suffice

# Execution #
#############
Neither the server, nor the client
have any argument needed. In order
to execute the server run:
$ java CentralServer
In order to execute the client run:
$ java Client

# Testing #
###########
To make stress testing easier
there is a special client made only 
to repeat the same task indefinitely.
In order to execute the test client run:
$ java ElatedClient [OPTION] DELAY USERNAME
OPTION is the kind of operations you 
want to run:
	0 - random operations
 	1 - auctions creation only
 	2 - bidding only
 	3 - listing of all items only
 	4 - listing of all available items only
DELAY is the amount of time between 
each operation. 0 is a valid value.
USERNAME is the username that will be 
used to access the server. This came in
hand when testing in multiple machines
at the same time since you can automate
the testing with a shell script.

also comes the shell script that I used
to test with multiple machines.
In order to execute the shell script
run:
$ sh clientTester.sh OPTION ITERATIONS DELAY WAIT_TIME
OPTION and DELAY are the same as with ElatedClient.
ITERATIONS is the number of times you want the
test client to run.
WAIT_TIME is the time (in seconds) before the 
script begins to run.

How I tested with multiple machines:
for each option between 1 and 4:
on each one of the "m" machines it was executed:
$ sh clientTester OPTION n d w
where OPTION==1?d=100:d=0 (because of the out 
of memory fault)
n = 1:m
w = m:1  (this is to give me some time for 
me to run all test clients at aproximaly 
the same time)

ElatedClient is set to return if it
looses the server connection. combine this 
with the shell script and in order for you
to go from m machines running to m-1 the
only thing you need to do is close the 
server and restart it. there is a 5 sec
delay between the end of the old execution
and the begining of the new one.

ElatedClient do not print any result on
the screen except for the time in millis
it took to perform an operation (since it
is very quick the numbers can build up 
even quicker).
